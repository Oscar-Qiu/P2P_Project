## <u>Project Limitations</u>

Choking/unchoking protocols are not implemented.

## <u>Running Program</u>

For local use:
1. Unzip project (if applicable)
2. If desired, change PeerInfo.cfg in /resources (each column describes peer id, peer address, port number, and if the peer has the file)
3. For testing locally, change adresses to localhost and make sure each port is different
4. If desired change Common.cfg to match the target file for download
5. Make sure there are enough peer folders (/peer_<peer id>) and they contain the target file depending on the cfg files
